# Making Requests for Data (Step 4/4)

In order for the client to make a request for the data, the client needs to have a valid access token.  Once the client has a valid access token (see [Obtaining Access Token](obtaining_request_token.md)), the client can use the below URI to make the request for data.

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Method</th>
        <th>URI</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>POST | GET</td>
        <td>https://api-staging.bgl360.com.au/fund/list</td>
    </tr>
</table>

The above URI will return the list of all available funds.  There are different variations in retrieving data.  This is explained in more detail in the [Resource Requests section](../resource_requests/README.md).

However, the client application needs to pass the access token and token type as header information in the request, as per the following table:

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Header variable name</th>
        <th>Value</th>
        <th>Example</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Authorization</td>
        <td>&lt;token_type&gt; &lt;access_token&gt;</td>
        <td>bearer df2f0e40-606f-4311-8066-590732fd126b</td>
    </tr>
</table>
